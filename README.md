Perfect! Let’s wrap this up into a **GitHub-ready repository** 📦 with clear structure and a nice README for deployment on **Railway**.  

Here’s the repo layout I suggest:  

---

## 📂 Repo Structure

```
zee5-proxy-railway/
│
├── app.py              # Flask proxy server (main code)
├── cookies.txt         # Cookies (must be updated manually when expired)
├── requirements.txt    # Dependencies
├── Procfile            # For deployment on Railway
└── README.md           # Documentation & usage guide
```

---

## 🐍 `app.py`

(Already given in my last answer, with `.m3u8` rewriting + chunk proxying).  
👉 Copy that exactly into `app.py`

---

## 📜 `requirements.txt`
```txt
flask
requests
```

---

## 🚂 `Procfile`
Railway detects how to start app.  

```Procfile
web: python app.py
```

---

## 🍪 `cookies.txt`
This file should contain your cookie string like:
```
hdntl=exp=1756126167~acl=%2f*~data=hdntl~hmac=ed2cb662c7be...
```

Make sure to keep it up to date. Authentication cookies usually expire after a certain period.

---

## 📖 `README.md`

```markdown
# 🎬 Zee5 Proxy HLS Streamer (Railway Deploy)

This project is a **proxy server for Zee5 HLS streams** so you can play them directly in **VLC, Kodi, ffmpeg, etc.** without worrying about headers or cookies in your player.

---

## ✨ Features
- Proxies `.m3u8` playlists through Flask
- Rewrites playlist URLs → your `/proxy/` endpoint
- Supports `.m3u8` extension directly:
  ```
  https://yourapp.up.railway.app/play/zee_tv.m3u8
  ```
- Auto handles `ts/m4s` video chunks
- Deployable on **Railway** for cloud access

## 📂 Project Structure

```
zee5-proxy-railway/
├── app.py              # Main Flask server
├── cookies.txt         # Zee cookies (must be refreshed regularly)
├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
├── Procfile            # Run command for Railway
└── README.md           # Documentation
```

---

## 🚀 Running Locally

1. Clone repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zee5-proxy-railway.git
   cd zee5-proxy-railway
   ```

2. Create virtual environment & install deps:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Update `cookies.txt` with fresh Zee cookie string.

4. Run:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open in VLC:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/play/zee_tv.m3u8
   ```

---

## 🚂 Deploying on Railway

1. Install Railway CLI:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://railway.app/install.sh | sh
   railway login
   ```

2. Initialize project:
   ```bash
   railway init
   ```

3. Push to Railway:
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

4. Get your Railway URL (something like):
   ```
   https://yourproject.up.railway.app/
   ```

5. Test:
   ```
   https://yourproject.up.railway.app/play/zee_tv.m3u8
   ```

## ⚠️ Notes
- `cookies.txt` must be **manually updated** when expired.
- Railway free tier might have limited runtime/duration.
- This is for **educational/demo purposes only.** ✅

---

💡 Pro Tip: add a dictionary in `app.py` like
```python
CHANNELS = {
    "zee_tv": "zee_tv",
    "zee_cinema": "zee_cinema",
    "zee_news": "zee_news"
}
```
and use it to make friendly names.
```

👉 Next Step: Do you want me to generate the **GitHub-ready repo as a downloadable ZIP** for you, or just give you the exact files so you can `git init && push` yourself?
